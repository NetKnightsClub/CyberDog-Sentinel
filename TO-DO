fix/to-do list for `CyberDog`

[-TO-DO-]

make the [SAFE_MACS] in the rogue kicker a .conf file instead (to make it safer)
add more support for other devices- like a rasberry pi or a whole server- i dont even know anymore

[-FIX-]

main .py script doesnt work/show menu on kali linux only opens nmap--will try and fix later
